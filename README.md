## Description
"The Kacapp is a fun Flutter application cloned from a concept seen in the music video ‘Błąd’ by Łona and Webber. Its primary purpose is for amusement and learning. A fun fact is that when I was releasing the app on Google Play, I noticed that someone had the exact same idea and had created a similar application which has over a thousand downloads.
